This is a project based on HTML and CSS. 

A digital journaling website which can be accessed by login. 
I've learned a lot from this project on how to make my website for scratch, make it more appealing and user-friendly. It helped understand the basics of HTML and CSS.
My biggest challenge was to tackle the various types of values in CSS and really understand how the website layout is laid.
I want to build myself a portfolio right after the completion of this project
I'm still working on my skills and learning how to add JS and use of APIs to make it more responsive.
Thank you!

Currently this project is under progress
